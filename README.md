# Distributed System Project

**Course:** Software Systems
**Status:** In Development

**Team Members:**
1. Pawel Banasik: I don't like defining myself, don't make me do it. I like puzzles and coding, and coming up with innovative solutions to problems, that's about all that I will say.
2. Mikhail Rego: I am a curious, apprentice engineer who has a natural talent for organizing things and telling people "they're not doing doing what they're supposed to :yum:." Fun fact: I am crazy into both hard-core rock and hard-core country.
3. Glen Healy: I'm interested in building some cool electrical and software projects this semester.
4. [Member 4 Name Placeholder] (this is the artificail git conflict)
